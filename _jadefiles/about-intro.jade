          p Iâ€™m Rafael Medina, a product designer and front-end developer currently based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. One of my goals is to get to build amazing tools and products.
          //- p Much of my focus is spent thinking through design systems, designing interfaces, a bit of coding, photography, and illustration. When I am not working, I usually take trips to new places, or I am at home playing video games.
