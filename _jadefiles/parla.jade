            p Parla
          p Parla was a native iOS application that works to take some feedback from clients in an interactive way, giving points to the users and later on let them use them, working alongside their older SMS system.
          p The project got canceled while developing it but gained knowledge implementing and using Xcode and Swift animations and interface.
