# UI/UX Designer


### Overview
Condominium is a beautiful management app to the what matter the must, your community.
Homes are important, but your neighborhood they're the small things in life that matter the most. Whether it's an electric problem, a reservation in a community space to have a party with your friends, Days helps you manage those special moments.

The project began when I got contacted by a client from UK, who searched for a skilled UX/UI designer.
The clients plan was to work on the app as side project, but through the development process it became more than that.

###The Problem
After market research and competitor’s analysis we found that there are few similar mobile apps, that provide the same functionality, but they all offer very complex and buggy solutions.

The clients main idea was to create a condo’s managment app that would stand out, by creating a great user centric oriented experiences and meet the admin user expectations by allowing them to easily create, edit buildings and solve problems as quickly as possible. And therefore letting the end users, the ones living in the condo trust and use their app accounts.


The Challenge
The first challenge in the project was the number of team members. I was working with two developers. At that time I was aware, that the project will require for me to be involved into the development process from the very beginning to the very end and it will challenge us to deliver the user and the business needs.
The second challenge was to work through the low budget that was available. For advance planning this meant that we won’t have all the resources available and that our research will be based on any source that we could gather, to deliver a great product.








Research
We tried to stay focused through the research, by making it short and effective. We gathered as much data as possible from user feedbacks, technical reports, etc. We also created a detailed competitor analysis that gave us insights of current apps and helped us to meet the priorities to differentiate our product from all the others. The research phase continued with creating assumptions, that we later validated with surveys and user interviews.
We started to ask questions who are the users we are targeting, which features would be useful to them, what goals do they need to accomplish and what are the users needs and desires.



Epics And Design Stories
Epics are stories that are providing an overview of the features. They helped me think through my design decisions, to create and provide a useful user experience. In our case, epics were that user can: create, edit, view, share and delete their events.
We continued with writing design stories, and agile technique to capture the functionality of a product. We created detailed descriptions of what the user can do.
Our design stories:



Analysis
Our main goal was to create a user experience that will be simple, effective and only provides informations that user would need for an upcoming event. We created some online surveys and interviews users on the street. We noticed that a lot of the users are still using standard calendar apps as their tool for planing events in advance. The standard calendars cover the basic of creating appointments and schedule managements, but everyone has a different workflow and that opens door for other calendar apps to suit user needs.
Persona Development
In order to test our ideas and hypotheses, I created some fictional characters, to understand possible scenarios and to see which functions could be useful.



User Task Flow
Task flows helped us to think through the design, before a feature is actually developed. It helped us to interject the user into the flow of the application, and determine if the conceptual model agrees with the user model.
Wireframes
My next step was to visualize the user task flow. I started with some quick sketches and continued with creating high-fidelity mockups. Since we were going to use the mockups for user validation, we used as much real data as possible.
A/B Testing
By watching our test users use and fumble through our product or even just imagining using it, we quickly identified areas, where app is not simple or clear enough. We also made a commitment to make simplicity our top priority from day one and filtered every wireframe and piece of copy through questions: Is it simple enough? Is there anything we could simplify?
We created an alternative version of our product, introduced it to different users and compared the results to see which of the screens performs better.


Usability Test
When we performed a usability test, we experienced interesting user behavior pattern that we didn’t predict. We noticed that 70% of our users tried to tap on the photo they were sharing on our mobile screen (where users could share their events). After we asked them why they did this in most of the cases the answer was “I thought I can edit it”. We decided that this is a feature that is definitely worth solving to meet the user needs.
Gestures And Animations
Gestures add value to the user and we are designing not just what it looks like but how it behaves. The most important criterion for me is that these interactions feel very intuitive.
